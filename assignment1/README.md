### Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
    - Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. The experiment was conducted using Java.

2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
    - You can use any Java-compatible IDE of your choice. We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for a seamless experience.

### Reproducing the Experiment

Follow these steps to rerun the experiment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/DePoli97/exp-ev.git
      ```
    - Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP file.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    - Change into the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd ./assignment1
      ```

3. **Open the Project in Your IDE:**
    - Open the project using your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

4. **Configure Experiment Parameters:**
    - Locate the `Tester.java` file in the `src` directory.
    - Adjust the experiment parameters, such as array size, data types, and initial array order, based on your preferences.

5. **Run the Experiment:**
    - Run the `Tester.java` file to execute the experiment.
    - The program will generate random arrays, sort them using three algorithms, and record the execution times.

6. **View Results:**
    - After the experiment completes, view the results in a file named `sorting_results.csv` in the `src` directory.
    - Our statistical graphs and raw data are all provided in the `images` folder.

### Additional Notes
- **Explore and Modify:**
    - Feel free to explore the code, modify experiment parameters, or adapt the experiment to suit your research goals.

We hope this guide enables you to reproduce the experiment successfully. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy experimenting!
